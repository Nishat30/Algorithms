# Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm

The Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm is an efficient algorithm used to find the majority element in an array (an element that appears more than n/2 times), if it exists.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(n)
Average: O(n)
Worst: O(n)

## Space Complexity

O(1)

## Example Use Case

Determining the most common element in a list, such as finding the most frequently occurring color in a list of colors or the most frequent product purchased in a list of transactions.
