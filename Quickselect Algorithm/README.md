# Quickselect Algorithm

Quickselect is a selection algorithm that finds the k-th smallest element in an unsorted array. It is based on the partitioning step of the QuickSort algorithm and works by selecting a pivot and partitioning the array around the pivot.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(n)
Average: O(n)
Worst: O(n^2)

## Space Complexity

O(log(n))

## Example Use Case

Finding the k-th smallest element in an unsorted array, such as finding the median or any other order statistic in a dataset.
