# Counting Sort Algorithm

Counting Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that works by counting the occurrences of each distinct element in the input array and then constructing a sorted output array.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(n + k)
Average: O(n + k)
Worst: O(n + k)

## Space Complexity

O(n + k)

## Example Use Case

Sorting integers within a known, small range, such as sorting test scores or sorting characters in a string based on their ASCII values.
