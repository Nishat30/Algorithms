# Selection Sort Algorithm

Selection Sort is a simple, comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum or maximum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning or end of the sorted part.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(n^2)
Average: O(n^2)
Worst: O(n^2)

## Space Complexity

O(1)

## Example Use Case

Sorting a small dataset when the available memory is limited, as Selection Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm with a low space complexity.
