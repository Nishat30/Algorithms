# Euclid's Algorithm

Euclid's Algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. It is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(log(min(a, b)))
Average: O(log(min(a, b)))
Worst: O(log(min(a, b)))

## Space Complexity

O(1) for the iterative implementation
O(log(min(a, b))) for the recursive implementation

## Example Use Case

Calculating the GCD of two numbers, such as simplifying fractions or determining the coprimality of integers.
