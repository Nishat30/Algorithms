# KMP Algorithm

The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm is an efficient string matching algorithm that searches for occurrences of a pattern within a text without backtracking.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(n)
Average: O(n + m)
Worst: O(n + m)

## Space Complexity

O(m)

## Example Use Case

Searching for a pattern within a large text, such as finding all occurrences of a word in a document or detecting specific sequences in DNA data.
