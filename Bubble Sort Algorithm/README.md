Bubble Sort is a simple, comparison-based sorting algorithm that compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(n^2)
Average: O(n^2)
Worst: O(n*(n-1)/2 )

## Space Complexity

O(1)

## Example Use Case

Sorting a small dataset or sorting an array
