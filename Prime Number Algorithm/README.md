# Prime Number Algorithm

Prime number algorithms are used to determine if a given number is prime (only divisible by 1 and itself) or to generate prime numbers.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(√n) for basic primality test
Average: O(√n)
Worst: O(√n)

## Space Complexity

O(1) for basic algorithms
O(n) for sieve algorithms

## Example Use Case

Cryptography applications, generating prime numbers for RSA encryption, or mathematical computations requiring prime factorization.
