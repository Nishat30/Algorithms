# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a weighted, directed graph. It can handle negative edge weights but not negative weight cycles.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(V^3)
Average: O(V^3)
Worst: O(V^3)

## Space Complexity

O(V^2)

## Example Use Case

Finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph, such as determining the shortest driving times between all pairs of cities or the minimum communication latency between all pairs of computers in a network.
