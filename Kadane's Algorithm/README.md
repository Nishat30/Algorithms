# Kadane's Algorithm

Kadane's Algorithm is used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(n)
Average: O(n)
Worst: O(n)

## Space Complexity

O(1)

## Example Use Case

Finding the maximum profit from buying and selling stocks, or finding the maximum sum of elements in any contiguous subarray of an array.
