# Palindrome Algorithm

Palindrome algorithms are used to check if a string, number, or sequence reads the same forwards and backwards.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(n)
Average: O(n)
Worst: O(n)

## Space Complexity

O(1) for iterative approach
O(n) for recursive approach

## Example Use Case

Validating palindromic strings, checking palindromic numbers, or solving problems related to symmetric data structures.
