# Heap Sort Algorithm

Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by building a binary heap (either max-heap or min-heap) from the input array and then repeatedly extracting the maximum or minimum element and inserting it at the end of the sorted region.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(n _ log(n))
Average: O(n _ log(n))
Worst: O(n \* log(n))

## Space Complexity

O(1)

## Example Use Case

Sorting a large dataset when the available memory is limited, as Heap Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm with a good average and worst-case performance.
