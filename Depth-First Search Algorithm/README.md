# Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It can be implemented using either recursion or an explicit stack data structure.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(V + E)
Average: O(V + E)
Worst: O(V + E)

## Space Complexity

O(V)

## Example Use Case

Finding a path between two vertices in a graph, such as solving a maze or determining whether a sequence of dependencies can be satisfied in a build system.
