# Bellman-Ford Algorithm

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a graph search algorithm that finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted, directed graph. It can handle negative weight edges, but not negative weight cycles.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(V _ E)
Average: O(V _ E)
Worst: O(V \* E)

## Space Complexity

O(V)

## Example Use Case

Finding the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with potential negative weight edges, such as currency exchange rates or transportation costs.
