# Insertion Sort Algorithm

Insertion Sort is a simple, comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It is best suited for small or partially sorted datasets.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(n)
Average: O(n^2)
Worst: O(n^2)

## Space Complexity

O(1)

## Example Use Case

Sorting a small dataset or sorting an array that is already partially sorted, such as inserting new elements into a sorted list or maintaining the order of elements in a list as they are modified.
