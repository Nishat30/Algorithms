# Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in breadthward motion. It explores all neighboring vertices at the current level before moving on to the vertices at the next level.

## Time Complexity

Best: O(V + E)
Average: O(V + E)
Worst: O(V + E)

## Space Complexity

O(V)

## Example Use Case

Finding the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph, such as determining the minimum number of steps to reach a destination in a maze or the degrees of separation between two people in a social network.
